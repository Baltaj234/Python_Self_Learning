# Showcasing how while loops work in Python
x = 1

while i < 6:
    print(x)
    if x == 3:
        break
    i += 1

# Break allows us to stop the loop when a certain 
# condition is met

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# The continue statement allows us to continue the loop
# when a certain condition is met


i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")

  # Printing a message once the condition is false
